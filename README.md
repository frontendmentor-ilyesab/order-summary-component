There was nothing new in this project it's similar to the other projects that are part of the **Getting Started on Fronted Mentor roadmap.**

However it helps to solidify the layout/spacing skills used frequently when designing web pages.

### Continued development
Getting more practice in regards to simple layouts before moving to more complex/responsive ones.
